#include <iostream>
//iostream is a header file that contain functions for basic input and output operations
//by writing include iostream we are including that header file in our program,
//then we have access to a whole bunch of useful input and output operations.

//the main function is where the program begins ,we begin the program by invoking the main function
int main(){
	 //To write some output we have to type std 
	 std::cout<<"Harsh Bairagi" <<std::endl;
	 std::cout<<"My father name is Dinesh Bairagi" <<'\n'; 
	 std::cout<<"My mother name is Shanti Bairagi" <<std::endl;
	 
	
	
	//If we reach return 0 ,that means there were no problems in the program,
	// however if 1 is returned that means there was a problem,
	// so place return 0 at the end of your main function. 
	return 0;
